# A function that controls the calibration of models

This function is used to further control some aspects of the calibration
of models (with the
[`calibrate`](https://buchi-labortechnik-ag.github.io/proximetricsR/reference/calibrate.md)
function) such as cross-validation and outlier detection.

## Usage

``` r
calibration_control(validation_type = c("lgo", "loo", "kfold", "none"),
                    number = ifelse(validation_type == "lgo", 100, 10),
                    p = 0.75,
                    folds = c("random", "sequential"),
                    tuning_parameter = c("rmse", "rsq", "none"),
                    learning_rates = c(maximum = 1.1, sequential = 1.05),
                    remove_outliers = 0,
                    cal_residual_limit = 2.5,
                    mahalanobis_limit = 5,
                    val_residual_limit = 3.5,
                    allow_parallel = TRUE,
                    fix_pls_factors = TRUE,
                    fixed_components = 0,
                    replacements = TRUE,
                    seed = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- validation_type:

  a character string indicating the type of cross-validation (cv) to be
  conducted. Options are: `"lgo"` for leave-group-out cv (default),
  `"loo"` for leave-one-out cv and `"kfold"` for k-fold cv. See details.

- number:

  an integer indicating the number of sampling iterations or sub-sample
  groups for the selected `validation_type` argument. Default is `100`
  for leave-group out cv and `10` for k-fold cross-validation. This
  parameter is ignored for leave-one-out cv.

- p:

  a numeric value indicating the percentage of calibration observations
  to be retained at each sampling iteration at each local segment when
  `"lgo"` is selected in the `validation_type` argument. Default is 0.75
  (i.e. 75 percent of the observations).

- folds:

  a character string indicating the way folds are created (valid only
  when `validation_type = "kfold"`). Options are: `"random"` (default)
  or `"sequential"`.

- tuning_parameter:

  a character string indicating which cross-validation statistic to use
  for the optimization of the included number of components. Options
  are: `"rmse"` (default, minimization of the root mean squared error),
  `"rsq"` (maximization of the coefficient of determination) or `"none"`
  (no tuning). Does not apply when `validation_type = "none"`.

- learning_rates:

  a vector of length 2 for additional control over the selection of the
  optimal number of components. See details for its use. Defaults to
  `c(1.1, 1.05)`.

- remove_outliers:

  an integer indicating the number of times the model should
  automatically detect and remove outliers. Each time, a new model is
  fitted with the outliers removed, until either no more outliers are
  found or the `remove_outliers` has been reached. Outliers found and
  removed in each step, as well as the first and last computed models
  are recorded. Outliers are detected based on the limits set in the
  arguments `cal_residual_limit`, `mahalanobis_limit` and
  `val_residual_limit`. Setting `remove_outliers` to `0` (default)
  disables automatic outlier removal, whereas selecting it as `Inf`
  removes outliers until no more are found.

- cal_residual_limit:

  a numeric value which indicates the upper limit of the standardized
  residuals for the fitted response variable. Observations with absolute
  residuals above this limit are labeled as `"calibration outliers"`.
  The standardized calibration residuals are calculated as the absolute
  differences between the reference values and their corresponding
  fitted values divided by the standard deviation of these absolute
  differences. Default is 2.5 (as in NIRWise PLUS calibration software).

- mahalanobis_limit:

  a numeric value which indicates the upper limit of the squared
  Mahalanobis distances of each sample in the score space to zero.
  Observations with squared Mahalanobis distance above this limit are
  labeled as `"Mahalanobis outliers"`. The squared Mahalanobis distances
  are calculated as the squared Euclidean distance of the standardized
  scores to the origin. Default is 5 (as in NIRWise PLUS calibration
  software).

- val_residual_limit:

  a numeric value which indicates the upper limit of the standardized
  residuals for cross-validation predictions of the response variable.
  This applies only to `"kfold"` or `"loo"` cross-validation.
  Observations with absolute residuals above this limit are labeled as
  `"validation outliers"`. The standardized validation residuals are
  calculated as the absolute differences between the reference values
  and their corresponding cross-validated predictions divided by the
  standard deviation of these absolute differences. Default is 3.5 (as
  in NIRWise PLUS calibration software).

- allow_parallel:

  a logical indicating if parallel execution is allowed. If `TRUE`,
  parallelization is applied to the cross-validation procedure. The
  parallelization of this for loop is implemented using the
  [`foreach`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/foreach/man/foreach.html) function of
  the `foreach` package. Default is `TRUE`.

- fix_pls_factors:

  a logical. This parameter only has an influence on the produced
  application files, where it indicates whether the final number of
  factors of the model should be fixed. Note that this has no influence
  on the model in R itself, as the optimal number of components inside
  the model remains the same (but it does influence the exported files).
  Default is `TRUE`.

- fixed_components:

  a numerical value indicating a fixed number of components to be used
  in the model (i.e. no optimization of the components). The default
  value is `0`, which indicates that the number of components is not
  fixed and it uses the one selected by the function.

- replacements:

  a logical. Only used in case `validation_type` is selected as `"lgo"`.
  Specifies if the sampling for the calibration sets must be done with
  replacements. See details for a more thorough explanation. Defaults to
  `TRUE`.

- seed:

  an integer that can be used in any of the validation methods to obtain
  reproducible results, using the
  [`set.seed`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) function. In case it
  is selected as `NULL`, no seed will be set. Note that the seed will
  not be reset, and future random computations can be affected.
  Furthermore, this parameter is meant as a way to provide
  reproducibility, and should not be used to simply select the seed with
  the best results. Default is `NULL`.

## Value

a list of class `calibration_control` mirroring the specified parameters

## Details

This package extends the cross-validation methods implemented in the
NIRWise PLUS software, which is based only on k-fold cross validation.

The validation methods available for assessing the predictive
performance of the models are:

- **Leave-group-out cross-validation (`"lgo"`):** The data is
  partitioned into different subsets of similar size. Each partition is
  based on a stratified random sampling using the distribution of the
  response variable. When `p` \\\ge\\ 0.5 (i.e. the number of
  calibration observations to retain is larger than 50% of the total
  samples), the sampling is conducted for selecting the validation
  samples, and when `p` is below 0.5 the sampling is conducted for
  selecting the calibration samples (samples used for model training).
  The model fitted with the selected calibration samples is used to
  predict the target response variable values of the validation samples.
  The accuracy and precision, indicated by the root mean square error
  (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (\\R^2\\) respectively,
  are computed. This process is repeated \\m\\ times (where \\m\\ is
  controlled by the `number` argument), and the final RMSE and \\R^2\\
  are computed as the average over all respective results of the \\m\\
  iterations. In case the parameter `replacements` is set to `TRUE`, the
  selection of the calibration sets is done by using sampling with
  replacement.

- **Leave-one-out cross-validation (`"loo"`):** The number of iterations
  is equal to the number of observations in the calibration set. In each
  iteration, one single observation is held out, while the remaining
  samples are used to fit a model, which is used to predict the response
  variable of the held out observation. The predictions are then
  compared to the reference ones and both the RMSE and the (\\R^2\\) are
  computed.

- **k-fold cross-validation (`"kfold"`):** The data is split (either
  randomly or sequentially) into \\k\\ disjoint blocks of similar size,
  where \\k\\ is controlled by `number`. In the sequential splits, every
  block \\B_i\\ is selected as follows:

  \\B_i = \lbrace i + k(j - 1) \| j \in N, \\ i + k(j - 1) \leq n
  \rbrace\\

  where \\n\\ is the total number of observations. In other words, the
  observations are put sequentially into the blocks until all
  observations have a block assigned.  
  A total of \\k\\ iterations is conducted. In each iteration, one block
  is considered as the validation set, while the remaining samples are
  used to fit a model, which is then used to predict the response
  variable of the held-out block.  
  The number observations in each block is given by the total number of
  observations divided by the number of blocks. Note that the maximum
  number of folds is limited to half of the number of observations. Note
  also that this implementation of k-fold cross-validation is an
  improved version of the one in the NIRWise PLUS software, where only
  the sequential sample selection is supported.

- **No validation (`"none"`):** No validation is carried out.

For each validation type (except `"none"`), the optimal number of
factors is not necessarily chosen to be the minimum of RMSE or the
maximum of \\R^2\\ (depending on the `tuning_parameter`). Instead, since
both are often monotonically decreasing respectively monotonically
increasing as the number of components increases, an additional
parameter `learning_rates` \\\gamma\\ for fine-tuning of the
determination of the number of factors is included:

For RMSE, consider the index where the minimum of all computed RMSE is
attained:

\\n\_{min} = arg\min\_{n} \\ RMSE_n\\,

Then, among all \\1 \lt n \lt n\_{min}\\ fulfilling

\\RMSE\_{n} \lt RMSE\_{n\_{min}} \cdot \gamma\_{max}\\

\\RMSE\_{n} \lt RMSE\_{n+1} \cdot \gamma\_{seq}\\

we take the smallest \\n\\ as the optimal number of components.  
For \\R^2\\, a similar approach is taken, but with maxima instead of
minima: \\n\_{max} = arg\max\_{n} R^2_n\\ Then, take the smallest \\1
\lt n \lt n\_{max}\\ still satisfying

\\R^2\_{n} \gt R^2\_{n\_{max}} \cdot \gamma\_{max}^{-1}\\

\\R^2\_{n} \gt R^2\_{n+1} \cdot \gamma\_{seq}^{-1}\\

Note that in this case, we take the inverse of the learning rates.
Furthermore, setting `learning_rates = c(1, 1)` retains the global
minimum for RMSE, respectively maximum for \\R^2\\.
