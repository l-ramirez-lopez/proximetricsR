#' @title Write data files for ProxiScout devices

#' \loadmathjax
#'
#' This function writes comma-separated files in a format compatible with
#' ProxiScout-related software, which typically require separate comma-separated
#' files - one file for the spectra, another for reference values, and a third one
#' holding all remaining metadata columns.
#' These files are created inside the specified directory (argument `path`).
#' @usage
#' proxiscout_write_data(x, path, file_prefix, properties = NULL, spc = "spc")
#' @param x a `data.frame` of spectral data for which to write the data files.
#' Typically, this is returned by \code{\link{proxiscout_read_data}} and of class
#' `"proxiscout_data"`.
#' @param path a character for the directory in which the files will be saved.
#' @param file_prefix a character for the prefix of the generated files. The files
#' are then named as `[file_prefix]_spectra.csv`, `[file_prefix]_properties.csv`
#' and `[file_prefix]_metadata.csv`. Default is `proxiscout_export`.
#' @param properties a vector of characters of arbitrary length. Which properties
#' in \code{x} are to be added to the csv? Default is \code{NULL}.
#' @param spc either a character or a vector of integers. Specifies where the
#' spectra can be found inside \code{x}. Default is \code{"spc"}.
#' @return A `character` with the paths to the created files.
#'
#' @details
#' This function creates up to three comma separated files in the directory `path`,
#' which are usable by ProxiScout-related software. These files are named according
#' to the `file_prefix` argument and contain the spectra together with the sample
#' names and device ID, respectively the reference values with the sample names, and
#' a metadata file with the sample names and all remaining columns.
#'
#' Typically, the data provided to this function is imported with \code{\link{proxiscout_read_data}}
#' and of class `"proxiscout_data"`, but it is also possible to construct a `data.frame`
#' by hand and provide it to this function.
#'
#' The `properties` argument specifies which columns in `x` are the reference values
#' written to the `[file_prefix]_properties.csv` file. If empty (default), this
#' file is not created, as it would only contain sample names. Any row in the
#' provided properties that only contains `NA` values are dropped. In general,
#' `NA` values are set to an empty string (`""`)
#'
#' The sample names are detected automatically from `x` as the column with a name
#' that contains `"sample"`. If none are detected, the function will throw an
#' error. This column is named `"sampleName"` in every file.
#'
#' Similarly, the device ID is a required column and is identified as having a
#' `"device"` string inside the name of the column. This column is only written into
#' the `[file_prefix]_spectra.csv` file, with a fixed name `"deviceId"`.
#'
#' All other columns in either file only correspond to the spectra respectively
#' the reference values. All columns in `x` that are not written to any of the
#' other files - i.e. that are neither the spectra, the sample name, the device id
#' nor the selected `properties` - are written to the `[file_prefix]_metadata.csv`
#' file, together with the sample names (as `"sampleName"`). As with the properties
#' file, this metadata file is only created when there is at least one such column,
#' otherwise it would only contain the sample names.
